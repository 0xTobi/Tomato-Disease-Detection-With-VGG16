    Welcome to the Tomato Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

                #### About the VGG16 Transfer Learning Model
                VGG16 is a popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture originally developed by the Visual Graphics Group at Oxford University. It consists of 16 layers with learnable weights, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.

                In this project, we utilize VGG16 with transfer learning, leveraging its pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset. Transfer learning allows us to adapt the powerful features learned by VGG16 to our specific task of tomato disease detection. By fine-tuning the top layers of the model, we achieve high accuracy in classifying healthy and diseased tomato leaves.
                
                #### About Dataset
                This dataset was generated through offline augmentation from the original dataset, which is available on this GitHub repo. It comprises 26,503 RGB images of healthy and diseased tomato leaves, categorized into 10 classes. The dataset is split 80/20 into training and validation sets, with 21,043 images (80%) for training and 5,460 images (20%) for validation, maintaining the directory structure.

                The dataset combines two sources:
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf/data
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data
                
                A separate directory with 16 test images was created for prediction purposes.
